Optiswift is committed to ensuring that personal data processed by the company is accurate and up to date in line with the provisions of the applicable data protection law.

		<br>
		<h2>Privacy Notice Updates</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>12.1.	Optiswift may at any time amend, delete, or add to its Privacy Notice by giving notice of such changes or posting a revised version of our Privacy Notice on our website. Any change will be made unilaterally by us and you will have been deemed to be informed of these changes by your continuous use of our services after the revised Privacy Notice is uploaded. Where there is a fresh processing requirement which is not envisaged at the time of your onboarding with us and is not covered by the existing lawful basis we have (consent or otherwise), we will request your consent or rely on any other lawful basis in accordance with applicable laws. We will make efforts to display a notice of any change to our Privacy Notice on our website. Notwithstanding this, you further agree that it is your sole responsibility to check for updates of the Privacy Notice.</li>
				<li>12.2.	If you do not accept any change, you will be required to close your Optiswift user account, otherwise you will be deemed to be on notice and comfortable with the new terms. Any closure of the account still renders you liable to Optiswift for any liability incurred by you prior to closure.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Correspondence</h2>
		<p>Should you send us correspondence including chats, calls, emails and letters, we will retain such information in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from Optiswift to you. The rationale for this retention is to keep records of our relationship, measure and improve customer service and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our User Agreement. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>14.1.	Optiswift is committed to managing customer information with the highest standards of information security. We protect your personal information using physical, technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of Information we have physical, electronic and managerial procedures in place to keep your information safe. Once logged into your Optiswift account, all internet communication is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology and the connection is encrypted and authenticated using AES 128bit encryption key and uses Elliptic Curve Diffie-hellman key exchange (ECDHE) RSA as a key exchange mechanism and only authorised access to personal information is granted only to employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities.</li>
				<li>14.2.	The security of your Optiswift user account also rests on the protection of your PIN. You should not share your PIN with anyone and no employee of Optiswift will ever ask you for either of these so any email or correspondence requesting for such information should be treated as unauthorised and suspicious and forwarded to  <a href="dpo@optiswift.io">dpo@optiswift.io.</a> We will endeavour to respond to such emails as soon as possible.</li>
				<li>14.3.	Should you share your PIN with any third parties, such third parties will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for any actions taken using this information. Optiswift shall not be liable or responsible for any breach or loss arising from the disclosure of your PIN or other private information to any third parties. In the event you suspect a third party has gained access to your PIN, please log into your Optiswift profile, change it and notify us straightaway.</li>
				<li>14.4.	Although we make good faith efforts to store Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Information. If we become aware that your Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Notice, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Phishing</h2>
		<p>Optiswift takes appropriate measures to ensure that your Personal Data is only processed and retained for a period in line with the purposes set out in this Notice, as is stated under our data retention policy, or as required by applicable laws. We will also determine what action is to be carried out after the period stated in policies expired.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Inquiries</h2>
		<p>Optiswift is responsible for ensuring that our day-to-day procedures are aligned with this Privacy Notice. Should you have any questions about this Privacy Notice, Optiswift's information services or your transactions on Optiswift, you can contact us via our customer helplines or by email to <a href="dpo@optiswift.io">dpo@optiswift.io</a>.</p>
