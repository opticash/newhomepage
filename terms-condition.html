		<h2>Transaction </h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The Platform  allows you to send money from any of the countries in which we operate (the “Supported Countries“) to any person or business in the same or another Supported Country (the “Recipient“).
				</li>
				<li>
					We reserve the right to cease providing the Services in any of the Supported Countries at any time and without any notice to you.
				</li>
				<li>
					To request a money transfer to a Recipient, you will need to
					<ul>
						<li>Deposit an equivalent amount in an account which we will provide to you and within a timeframe which we will stipulate;</li>
						<li>a)	Upon confirmation of your payment in the account provided above, and within the time allotted, provide payment instructions through the Platform, including the recipient’s full name, address, bank account number, the amount you wish to send (the “Transaction Amount“), and any other information which we may ask you to provide.It is solely your responsibility to make sure all the transaction details are accurate before submission.<br>

							You understand that providing inaccurate details can cause delays in processing your transaction or lead to your transaction being cancelled. Once a transaction has been submitted for processing, we may, at our sole discretion, attempt to cancel a transfer at your request, but cannot guarantee success in such efforts if a transfer has been duly authorised and submitted.
							</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Before you confirm a transaction, we will provide you with the conversion rate that will be applied to your transaction and the fee we will charge for the transaction (the “Transaction Fee“).We will provide you with the estimated amount the recipient will receive (the “Payout Amount“) after currency conversion and deduction of the Transaction Fee.
				</li>
				<li>
					The actual amount that the Recipient receives may differ from the Payout Amount due to additional fees applied by banks or other service providers. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you confirm that you would like to initiate a transaction, we can either deduct the Transaction Amount and required Transaction Fee from your User Account, generate a unique transaction identification number, and provide you with funding instructions, including our bank account details or request you to provide your card details (collectively, “Payment Method”), so that you can deposit the Transaction Amount and pay us the required Transaction Fee.
				</li>
				<li>
				The funds will be paid into the recipient bank account using the transaction details you provided in the online form. Once your Transfer has been accepted and the Transaction Amount and Transaction Fee have been received by us, we will aim to credit the Transaction Amount to the recipient bank account in the currency requested.
				</li>
				<li>
					We will attempt to process transactions promptly, but any transaction may be delayed or cancelled for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: our efforts to verify your identity; to validate your transaction instructions; to contact you; or otherwise to comply with applicable law; or due to variations in business hours and currency availability; or due to additional compliance requirements or/and operating procedures and business guidelines our partners have in place.
				</li>
				<li>
					Banks have specified times for cutoffs for the receipt and dispatch of electronic payments. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot be held liable for any delay in onward payment attributable to the late arrival of funds or instructions for payment related to the cutoff times of the designated bank.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you notice that funds that do not belong to you have been credited to your account, you must inform us immediately. If an amount is incorrectly credited to your User Account, we may debit it without your separate consent. If you no longer have the funds in your User Account to cover such a debit, you must repay us within 3 Working Days of receiving our request. If you fail to cooperate and refund the funds, we will take legal and enforcement action.
				</li>
				<li>
					We may refuse to authorise any use of the Platform that could breach these terms and conditions or if we have reasonable grounds for suspecting that you or a third party have committed or are planning to commit fraud or any other illegal or un-permitted use of the Platform.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Exchange Rate </h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The foreign exchange conversion rate shown on the Platform is the rate applicable for currency conversion transactions done at that particular day and time.
				</li>
				<li>
					The exchange rates specified on the Platform may fluctuate from time to time in accordance with fluctuations in international exchange rate markets.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each time you use the Platform to transfer money, the exchange rate and the fee we are charging for the Service will be made available to you before the transaction is completed.
				</li>
				<li>
					When you initiate a transaction, we agree to transfer the Transaction Amount to the Recipient at the rate specified on the Platform at that time.
				</li>
				<li>
					The total amount (the Transaction Amount, Transaction Fee and other applicable fees and charges) that you will be required to pay and the relevant exchange rate will be displayed clearly on the Platform before you are asked to confirm your Transaction and proceeding with the Transaction at this point is entirely optional.
				</li>
				<li>
					Where we have confirmed the deposit of your payment, this exchange rate will apply even where there is a delay in processing your transaction. However, you understand that an exchange rate may change after 5 mins after the initiation of a transaction and you do not complete the transaction by sending us, and we confirming, your payment.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Fees</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you submit a transaction that results in us becoming liable for fees or charges, such as chargebacks or other fees, you agree to reimburse us for all such fees.
				</li>
				<li>
					We are not responsible for any charges applied by the recipient’s bank resulting from the receipt of funds into the recipient’s bank User Account.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should contact the recipient’s bank directly for details about any such charges that may be applicable to the transaction.
				</li>
				<li>
					Your User Account will not earn any interest. Also, you will not be entitled to any interest for the period during which the funds to be remitted are with the Bank, or pending remittance, in the course of remittance, or for any other period. 
				</li>

		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Cancellation and Refund </h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you use the Platform  then you have a right to cancel this Terms within a period of 14 days beginning on the date of the successful registration of your User Account, to withdraw from this Terms  and cancel Service, without any penalty, but subject to deduction of any reasonable costs incurred by us in the performance of any part of the provision of Service before you cancel. You must contact us within this 14-day period and inform us that you wish to withdraw from this Terms and you must not use the Service. We will then cancel the Service and reimburse the available balance on the User Account to you. However, we reserve the right to hold the available balance for up to 30 business days from receipt of your instructions before returning the balance to ensure that details of all Transactions have been received.
				</li>
				<li>
					After this cancellation period, you may only terminate the Service as described in the termination section.
				</li>
				<li>
					After the Transaction Amount has been sent to the Recipient you cannot request for a refund.
